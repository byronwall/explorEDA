# Demo datasets

Each dataset tests a different exploration task. Keep this set small. Do not use large random files as the default welcome experience.

The source file uses a semicolon delimiter. The current CSV parser detects it automatically.

## Shop Operations

- File: `shop-operations.csv`
- Size: 500 rows and 15 fields
- Use: dates, categories, booleans, nulls, skew, seasonality, and clear outliers
- Generation: fixed seed in `apps/data-samples/sample_data.ts`

The fixture contains these fields:

- order date, region, channel, category, product, and customer segment
- units, unit price, discount, revenue, cost, and margin
- fulfilled, returned, and delivery days

Dates repeat through 2024 for visible seasonality. Units use a right-skewed distribution with two large orders. Discount and delivery days include blank values for null handling.
